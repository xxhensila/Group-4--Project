My task for this week is same as in the previous one, but this time with more progress. We started working on our ideas for the Customer's Front End View. 
We decided to include a "Review" section in the Customer's View.

In our fourth meeting, we focused on discussing the project's requirements and how we would proceed with creating diagrams. 
Specifically, we discussed the roles and actions of the Admin and Supplier and their respective pages' views, as well as how the back-end 
and front-end will be connected.
We made important decisions regarding our progress and plans for the upcoming weeks, including re-checking the requirements to ensure they are 
complete and finalizing them.
